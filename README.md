Reflection on your experience with this assignment: I set up print statements all through my nextStep() code while doing it. This ended up not being necessary for debugging the function since it worked on the first run, but it was extremely useful while working on my ReadFile code, which took a lot more versions to work. In the future, I might do this more often rather than add print statements more gradually as they become necessary.
